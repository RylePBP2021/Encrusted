The code is already in place to read the images, all that is needed is textures that aren't crappy placeholders.

The textures here are printed directly on top of the in game textures for that item.
Please replace the files in this folder with the art you make, however, do not change the name of the file.
Also, don't worry about the "dev_gem" stuff, that's just for testing so it really doesn't need a texture.
If you want to create a new image for the actual ruby item itself, go ahead, but it isn't necessary.
Just push to the master branch whenever you add a new image.

Thank you so much for your help!!!
